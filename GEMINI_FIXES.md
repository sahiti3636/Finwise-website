# Gemini API Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fallback Response Issue**
**Problem**: The code was explicitly returning fallback responses instead of parsing actual Gemini responses.

**Files Fixed**:
- `finwise_backend/core/views.py` - ChatbotView, BenefitsView, ReportsView

**Changes Made**:
- Removed hardcoded fallback returns
- Added proper JSON parsing for Gemini responses
- Added fallback parsing for non-JSON responses
- Added comprehensive error handling

### 2. **Virtual Environment Issue**
**Problem**: The Django server wasn't running with the virtual environment activated, causing import errors.

**Solution**: 
- Always activate the virtual environment before running the server
- Use the provided `run_project.sh` script

### 3. **API Key Configuration**
**Status**: ✅ Working correctly
- API key is properly loaded from `.env` file
- Gemini API is responding successfully

## How to Run the Project

### Option 1: Use the provided script (Recommended)
```bash
./run_project.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual setup
```bash
cd finwise_backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

## API Key Management

### Do you need to provide the API key each time?
**No!** The API key is stored in the `.env` file and will be automatically loaded each time you run the project.

### Current API Key Status
- ✅ API key is configured in `finwise_backend/.env`
- ✅ API key is being loaded correctly
- ✅ Gemini API is responding successfully

### To change the API key:
1. Edit `finwise_backend/.env`
2. Replace the current key with your new key
3. Restart the server

## Debugging Features Added

The code now includes debug prints to help troubleshoot:
- `Gemini: API key loaded: Yes/No`
- `Gemini: Successfully generated response`
- `Gemini: Successfully parsed response`
- Error messages for failed parsing

## What Was Fixed

1. **Chatbot Responses**: Now properly uses Gemini AI instead of fallback responses
2. **Benefits Recommendations**: Now uses Gemini to generate personalized government benefits
3. **Tax Recommendations**: Already working correctly
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and fallback mechanisms

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fixes are working:

1. Start the server using the provided script
2. Navigate to the chatbot page
3. Ask a financial question
4. You should now see personalized Gemini responses instead of generic fallback messages

## Troubleshooting

If you still see fallback responses:

1. Check the server console for debug messages
2. Verify the virtual environment is activated
3. Ensure the `.env` file contains a valid API key
4. Check that `google-generativeai` is installed in the virtual environment
