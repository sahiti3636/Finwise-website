```python
# Core Models
- Book: Financial books with metadata
- UserReadingPreference: User's reading preferences

```

#### **ML Recommendation Algorithm**
```python

    # Base score from book rating (30%)
    score += book.rating * 0.3
    
    # Genre preference score (40%)
    if book.genre in preferences.preferred_genres:
        score += 0.4
    
    # Financial relevance score (30%)
    financial_relevance = calculate_financial_relevance(book, profile)
    score += financial_relevance * 0.3
    
    # Popularity bonus (10%)
    score += book.popularity_score * 0.1
    
    return score
```

#### **Financial Profile Analysis**
```python
def get_financial_genres(profile):
    genres = []
    
    # Income-based recommendations
    if profile.income > 1000000:  # High income
        genres.extend(['Business & Management', 'Investment'])
    elif profile.income > 500000:  # Medium income
        genres.extend(['Business & Management', 'Self-Help / Personal Growth'])

    # Age-based recommendations
    if profile.age < 30:
        genres.append('Self-Help / Personal Growth')
